# Ugly Sweaters
 
E-commerce site that sells original Christmas ugly sweaters.
 
 
## What is the purpose of this project
 
This project is supposed to help us to try as many html and css techniques as possible and at the same time to be usable. Aside of this we wanted to enjoy some fun programming it, so we came with the ugly sweaters idea.

 
## Why did you decide to make this project?

As first we chose that our main goal will be to programm e-commerce website. Some of us cannot wait for Christmas so we have tried to get some holiday spirit to our days already. However everything around Christmas seemed a bit boring until Marina mentioned ugly Christmas sweaters. We enjoyed even the research about them so we chose “selling” them.
And above all of that we think that not just us but all people need to have some fun nowadays. 


## Why did you decide to make this project?

We used some E-commerce site as a reference .
