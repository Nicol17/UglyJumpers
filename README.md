# Ugly sweaters

E-commerce site that sells original Christmas ugly sweaters.
 
 
## What is the purpose of this project
 
This project is supposed to help us to try as many html and css techniques as possible and at the same time to be usable. Aside of this we wanted to have some fun programming it, so we came with the ugly sweaters idea.

 
## Why did you decide to make this project?

As first we chose that our main goal will be to programm an e-commerce website. Some of us cannot wait for Christmas so we have tried to get some holiday spirit to our days already. However everything around Christmas seemed a bit boring until Marina mentioned ugly Christmas sweaters. We enjoyed even the research about them so we chose “selling” them.
And above all of that we think that not just us but all people need to have some fun nowadays. 


## Why did you decide to make this project?

We used some E-commerce site as a reference . 
Klarna

Revolve
https://www.revolve.com/dresses/br/a8e981/?navsrc=main

We used mainly google especially for images

## What was the most challenging part?

Deffinetly the most challenging part of the whole project was Github, everyone modifying the same files on a group project can create quite a few problems, pushing branches, pull requests and merging took more time than coding. Conflicts on style.css have been common due to selectors,therefore, multiple css files were applied in order to avoid conflicts.
