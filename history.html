            <h2>Where did it come from?</h2>
            <p>
                It's hard to say who invented the first ugly Christmas sweater. 
                As a matter of fact, we can presume that ugly sweaters were designed 
                with <span>the original intention of being fashionable.</span> 
                It's only because of ever-changing fashion trends that sweaters once deemed 
                acceptable are <span>now considered ugly.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                As a clothing item, ugly sweaters were 
                often featured on situation comedies <span>in the 1980s.</span> They were mostly cardigans, 
                buttoned down the front. The Christmas theme entered around the same time, 
                with the first mass-produced Christmas garments being made 
                under the name of "jingle bell sweaters" during the 1980s as well.

            <p>
                On the third Friday of December each year, people all over the World decide to wear 
                <span>hilariously hideous Xmas sweaters</span> and inflict this sight on everyone around them. 
                From garish green and red colours to pom-poms and nonsensical designs, 
                there seems to be no end to the dreadfully <span>silly designs on display.</span> 
                You’ll see these knit monstrosities at the office, out on the street, 
                and especially at holiday parties. This isn’t happening by accident. 
                The fashion-savvy and playful hearted <span>participants</span> in this trend <span>are celebrating 
                National Ugly Christmas Sweater Day.</span>
            </p>

                This trends <span>began in the 1980s</span> with The Cosby Show’s. Chevy Chase’s character 
                in National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation added the holiday twist to this look. 
                These well-known leading actors were playing decidedly unhip characters, 
                who had <span>no fashion sense at all.</span> But for some reason, the idea of wearing 
                awful sweaters as an ironic statement, somehow <span>caught on.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                In the early 2000s, <span>the first ugly holiday sweater party</span> was held in Vancouver, Canada. 
                All the guests were instructed to wear a hideous sweater, 
                and <span>interest in ugly sweaters was reborn.</span> Today, the party is still an annual hit 
                and the event routinely sells out the Commodore Ballroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having a day set aside to celebrate the season of silliness makes it easier to get folks 
                excited about this fun and festive event. Sources state that this is 
                <span>the third Friday of December.</span> In the end, it doesn’t matter which date you choose, 
                since ugly sweaters can and <span>should be worn more than once!</span>
